- API plugins enable declarative agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot to call REST APIs to retrieve data and perform tasks. However, these APIs must be hosted on servers that are addressable over the internet in order for Microsoft 365 Copilot to reach them.
- Use `/share` on agent chat to share debug session details with M365 support team.

###### M365 Declarative agent requires OpenAPI url are available over internet so local url will not work, Use `DevTunnel` to expose local url to make it available over internet.
